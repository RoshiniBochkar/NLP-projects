            "\n",
            "**1. WIDAL Test (Serology):** This test detects antibodies against *Salmonella* bacteria, which cause typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever.  The results are reported as dilutions.  A higher dilution indicating a stronger antibody response (and thus likely infection).\n",
            "\n",
            "* **S. Typhi \"O\" 1:160:**  This indicates a relatively high antibody titer (1:160 dilution) against the \"O\" antigen of *Salmonella Typhi*.  The \"O\" antigen is a somatic antigen (part of the bacteria's cell wall).  A titer of 1:160 suggests a possible past or current infection with typhoid fever.  Note that a positive result doesn't confirm active infection, and further investigation might be necessary.\n",
            "* **S. Typhi \"H\" 1:80:** This shows a moderate antibody titer (1:80 dilution) against the \"H\" antigen of *Salmonella Typhi*. The \"H\" antigen is a flagellar antigen (part of the bacteria's flagella, used for movement).  A titer of 1:80 is also suggestive but less strong than the \"O\" result.\n",
            "* **S. Paratyphi \"AH\" 1:20:** Antibody titer against the \"AH\" antigen of *Salmonella Paratyphi A* is within the reference range (1:20), suggesting no significant infection.\n",
            "* **S. Paratyphi \"BH\" 1:20:** Antibody titer against the \"BH\" antigen of *Salmonella Paratyphi B* is also within the reference range (1:20), suggesting no significant infection.\n",
            "* **Reference Range (1:20 Dilution):** This is the dilution below which the result is considered negative.  Results above this dilution suggest potential exposure or infection.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Dengue Serology:** This test screens for dengue fever, a viral infection spread by mosquitoes.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Dengue NS1 Antigen: Negative:**  The NS1 antigen is a protein produced by the dengue virus. A negative result means the antigen wasn't detected, suggesting no current dengue infection.\n",
            "* **Dengue IgG: Negative:**  IgG antibodies indicate a past infection with dengue virus.  A negative result suggests no prior dengue infection (or it's been too long for detectable IgG).\n",
            "* **Dengue IgM: Negative:** IgM antibodies are produced early in a dengue infection. A negative result suggests no current dengue infection.\n",

            "\n",
            "**3. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):** This measures the rate at which red blood cells settle in a blood sample over time. An elevated ESR can indicate inflammation or infection.\n",

The slightly elevated ESR and Widal test results (especially the \"O\" antigen titer) suggest a possible past or present infection, potentially typhoid.  However, the negative dengue and malaria tests, and mostly normal other values, suggest that these are not the primary concerns.  A physician should interpret these results in the context of the patient's clinical presentation and order any necessary follow-up tests.  The slightly low sodium warrants attention, and needs further investigation to rule out any cause.\n",
